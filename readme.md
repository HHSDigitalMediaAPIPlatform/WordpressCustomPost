## General Information
This is a Wordpress plugin that can be used to search and embed HHS Digital Media content.  It has been built and tested on Wordpress 3.9.1.  It is based on the pure HTML & Javascript module found [Here](https://github.com/HHSDigitalMediaAPIPlatform/HHSDigitalMediaModuleHTML).

## Installation & Setup
Download the plugin zip file "hhs-digital-media-syndication.zip". In Wordpress, install this plugin by going to the Plugins menu and uploading the zip file, then activate it. Once activated, you should find a new Post type named HHS Digital Media.  This post type can be used to display syndicated content. 

## Use
Create new HHS Digital Media post items.  First you must select a source for the content.  Then select a search type, which is either by metadata or by url.  For metadata searches you can filter out content by the last edited date, the media type, and topics.  Once you have entered metadata search criteria select a title to preview and save.  For Url search types enter a portion of the source content url and you should be presented with a list of content items with urls containing the entered text.  Select a url to preview and save.  Display options for the syndicated content are on the right column when editing the post.  These options can help with presentation problems due to conflicts with your site's theme.
